- Identify key **stakeholders** and beneficiaries, describing each role and their needs.
- Clarify the projectâ€™s core **value proposition** and high-level goals.
- List major **use cases** or user stories (e.g., "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]").
- Use **Gherkin syntax** (`Scenario:`, `Given/When/Then`) for functional requirements to ensure clarity and stakeholder understanding:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. For example:
    Scenario: User logs in successfully  
      Given a registered user is on the login page  
      When they submit valid credentials  
      Then they are redirected to their dashboard  

- Write Gherkin scenarios in plain language so both technical and non-technical stakeholders can follow the behavior specification:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
