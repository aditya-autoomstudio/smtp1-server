# Universal Ruleset Optimization Engine

## ðŸŽ¯ Identified Optimization Areas

Based on the current ruleset architecture, here are the key optimization opportunities:

### Current Architecture Issues
```yaml
optimization_analysis:
  redundancy_issues:
    - Multiple assessment layers with overlapping functionality
    - Repeated technology detection across different rules
    - Similar recommendation logic scattered across files
    - Duplicate success metrics and validation criteria
    
  complexity_issues:
    - Too many separate rule files to manage
    - Fragmented user experience across multiple guides
    - Cognitive overload with too many decision points
    - Unclear priority between competing recommendations
    
  efficiency_issues:
    - No centralized caching of assessment results
    - Repeated analysis for similar project patterns
    - No learning from previous optimization outcomes
    - Manual correlation between different guidance sources
```
